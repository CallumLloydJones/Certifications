## Data Science
I have completed the following Codecademy courses in general data science.
- Data Science (Foundations).
- Data Science (Machine Learning).

The following subjects were covered in these courses.
- Python Pandas for Data Science
- Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
- Statistics Fundamentals for Data Science
- Data Visualisation Fundamentals with Python
- Data Wrangling, Cleaning, and Tidying
- Communicating Data Science Findings
- Supervised Learning - Regressors, Classifiers, Trees, SVM's, Recommender Systems, and Naive Bayes
- Feature Engineering for Data Scientists
- Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks

The primary coding language involved in these courses was python, which I already had sufficient knowledge of beforehand. 

## Other courses
- Learn R
- Learn SQL
- Learn Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

When looking at requirements for many data science roles, R and SQL are often listed. Web scraping is another useful tool in data science that I wished to learn about.
